# AW-Agent-Simulator
Some experiments in the economy of Brain Burst

Update (June 17, 2019)

The first version of the GUI is out!  It is in `matlabFcn`, and needs to be installed.

To install, go into `matlabFcn > AWSimApp > for_redistrobution`, and open `AWAgentSim`.  
It needs to install MATLAB Runtime, which lets you run matlab based applications without a full install of Matlab.
This is great for letting mechE's like me who can't use actually program.

The most recent update doesn't support the Save tab on the Run tab, because it doesn't let us open extra figures.
Track Players is planned to be released soon, but the hope is to get it out and let people test it and be angry at me for bugs.
The workaround for this is that you can share the saved data files, and you can have other people open it with the app and look through your data.

If you have Matlab 2019a, you can use the Matlab App, which probably will work better for saving files.
